# Write a Python program to create and display all combinations of letters, selecting each letter from a different key in a dictionary.

Sample data : {'one':['a','b'], 'two':['c','d']}
Expected Output:  [ac, ad, bc, bd]

**Notes:**
* Define a function which will accept a dict parameter.
* For all present keys it will fetch values and will create a pair as described in above example.
* Store it in list and return.
